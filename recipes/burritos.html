        Burritos are my all-time favorite food medium, they combine many
        fantastic ingredients, yet they're so convenient to eat and make!
        All you really need to do is wrap some tasty stuff in a tortilla 
        and enjoy! However, if you're like me and need things spelled out 
        for you, here's my recipe for simple and tasty beef and bean burritos.
